## Description

This project uses the React.JS platform to create a working portfolio. I will server content for each page via the app.js file and will appear seamless to the end user. Using React.JS for this portfolio will increase my knowledge of JavaScript and also provide me a coded portfolio that can be used for searching employment.

---

## Motivation

As a new full stack developer I was in need of a portfolio that will showcase my skills via the portfolio and a provide a showcase for my projects.
